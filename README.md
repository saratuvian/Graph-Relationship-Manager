# Graph-Relationship-Manager
This project implements a graph data structure where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. It supports adding nodes, establishing connections between them, and finding paths. Using depth-first search (DFS), the system efficiently discovers and prints the shortest path between two connected entities.
